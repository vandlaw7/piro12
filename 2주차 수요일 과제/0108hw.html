                formal, and you came in jeans?
                I thought you'd hate me...
                But you didn't.
                
                Remember the times I'd flirt with
                other boys just to make you jealous, and
                you were?
                I thought you'd drop me...
                But you didn't.
                
                There were plenty of things you did to put up with me,
                to keep me happy, to love me, and there are
                so many things I wanted to tell
                you when you returned from
                Vietnam...
                But you didn't.</p>
